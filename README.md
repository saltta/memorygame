# Memory Game

This Memory Game was developed with a simple and charming food theme.
Every card when clicked will reveal a little food icon.
The idea is to be quick and easy, the timer adds enough pressure for the game to be challenging yet enjoyable.
Just match the cards within the time limit and you will have victory!
