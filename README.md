# Memory Game

This Memory Game was developed with a simple and charming food theme.
Every card when clicked will reveal a little food icon.
The idea is to be quick and easy, the timer adds enough pressure for the game to be challenging yet enjoyable.
Just match the cards within the time limit and you will have victory!

## Bugs

After deploying via GitHub Pages I noticed my favicon was not being displayed in the deployed page although it worked on the test server.

This was fixed by adding this line of code:

    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" />

The game was tested on Windows 10 and MacOS in Firefox and Chrome, as well as an Adroid phone running a Chrome based browser, there were no bugs reported.
